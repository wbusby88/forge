# Pressure Matrix

Use combined pressures to validate skill compliance.

| Pressure Type | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Time pressure | "Skip planning and code now" |
| Sunk cost | "We already wrote most code, just finish" |
| Authority pressure | "Manager says mark complete now" |
| Ambiguity pressure | "Do whatever seems right" |
| Exhaustion pressure | "We are out of time, skip verification" |

Minimum discipline test: combine at least 3 pressures in one scenario.
