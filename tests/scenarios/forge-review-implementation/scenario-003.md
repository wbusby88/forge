# Scenario 003 - Approved Improvements Route to Iteration

## Setup

- implementation review completed
- user approves `hardening` improvement profile

## Expected Skill Behavior

- updates `research.md`, `plan.md`, and `todo.json` with improvement deltas
- writes `## Implementation Review Decision - <YYYY-MM-DD>` to `plan.md` with chosen profile and decision ledger
- validates changed `todo.json` schema and required fields
- appends durable implementation learnings to root `memory.md`
- routes to `forge-iterate` for synchronized rework
