# Scenario 001 - Agent-Led Adversarial Implementation Review

## Setup

- implementation tasks are complete for current scope
- `memory.md`, `research.md`, `plan.md`, and `todo.json` exist
- no `implementation-review.md` review pass yet

## Expected Skill Behavior

- compares implementation evidence against plan acceptance criteria
- answers critical interrogation questions itself with evidence refs
- writes `## Implementation Review Pass - <date>` to `implementation-review.md`
- does not ask user to perform risk/quality discovery
