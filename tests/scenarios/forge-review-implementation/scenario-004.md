# Scenario 004 - No Improvements Route to Verify

## Setup

- implementation review completed
- user declines suggested improvements and accepts residual risk

## Expected Skill Behavior

- logs residual risk acceptance in `implementation-review.md`
- produces reviewed implementation summary packet with traceable refs
- writes `## Implementation Review Decision - <YYYY-MM-DD>` to `plan.md` with profile `none`
- asks final approval gate before verification handoff
- routes to `forge-verify` after approval
