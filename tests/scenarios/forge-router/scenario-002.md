# Scenario 002 - Route to Iterate for Post-Implement Rework

## Setup

- `memory.md`, `research.md`, `plan.md`, and `todo.json` exist
- implementation is complete for current scope
- user requests change/refactor before verification

## Expected Skill Behavior

- routes to `forge-iterate`
- lists artifact and intent evidence for route decision
- does not route directly to `forge-verify` while rework is requested
