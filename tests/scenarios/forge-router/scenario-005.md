# Scenario 005 - Router Keeps Major Rework in Forge Iterate

## Setup

- full-plan artifacts exist and implementation has started
- user requests substantial post-implementation refactor before verification
- request implies potential architecture and acceptance-criteria deltas

## Expected Skill Behavior

- routes to `forge-iterate`
- explicitly indicates major-vs-standard classification is handled inside `forge-iterate`
- does not route directly to `forge-plan`
- does not route directly to `forge-verify`
