# Scenario 003 - Memory Update Decision

## Setup

- Quick change completed successfully
- No durable learning discovered

## Expected Behavior

- `quick.md` explicitly states why no `memory.md` update was required
- Completion still requires full-suite verification evidence and confirmation gate

## Variant

When durable learning exists:

- `memory.md` is updated with learning/pitfall/decision entry
- `quick.md` references what was persisted
